### 4. If a token you would like to see or send is not showing up, you will need to add it as a custom token. Click [here](https://support.mycrypto.com/tokens/adding-new-token-and-sending-custom-tokens.html) for instructions on how to add a token.

### 5. If you have a balance, you won't have to load it againâ€”it will automatically load in the future! Yay!
